- Eye blink detection with aspect ratio calculation
- Yawn detection with mouth aspect ratio
- Audio alerts for drowsiness warnings
- Visual indicators for different fatigue levels
- Adjustable sensitivity settings

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- OpenCV (cv2)
- dlib
- numpy
- scipy (for distance calculations)
- winsound (built-in Windows module for audio)
